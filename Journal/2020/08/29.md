*Good Morning ðŸ™‚ How are you feeling?*
Got up little late today â€¦ Feeling alright â€¦ 
*What are you looking forward to today?*
Looking forward to 
* having the documents ready for Mysore site
* setting up workflow for tasks in office (planning with tickers & calendar) â€¦ maybe plan only for first halfs so that second halfs are available for others to plan meetings â€¦ 
* exploring Zettlr for Zettlekasten
